Snake Game
=========

This repo holds the final project for FQ '22 Comp Eng 346: Microprocessor System Design, taught by Branden Ghena. 
Team Snake Shimmy was comprised of Katrina Baniak, Ali Levin, and Alison Park. The team wanted to replicate the notorious game Snake, but by also implementing a tilt sensor so that the player would  have to physically move a board to move the snake, allowing for a much more interactive game experience. The nRF52x Microbit and multiple I2C QWIIC hardware systems (Sparkfun Micro OLED, Sparkfun 6DOF tilt sensor, and an Adafruit gesture sensor) were used.
